## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
During this project, I reinforced my understanding of semantic HTML structure and responsive CSS layouts. I practiced using Flexbox and CSS Grid to create adaptable designs. I also improved my workflow with React components and styled-components for modular styling.

For example, I used semantic tags for better accessibility:

```html
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup flour</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</main>
```

And applied custom properties in CSS for consistent theming:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #7b3f00;
}

body {
  color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

This project helped me better structure my code and focus on maintainability.
### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills with responsive design, accessibility best practices, and optimizing performance. I also plan to deepen my understanding of advanced CSS techniques and explore more efficient ways to manage state in React applications.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Comprehensive resource for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation and best practices.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Used for designing and prototyping the layout before development.
